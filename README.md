# PSG-GPC-framework

This is the code base used in Smith et al. 2020 to create PSG configuration files and submit jobs to the Goddard Private Cloud.

Current version notes: An installation of PSG in a docker container is required to execute the files, but included files can create configuration files.

Basic use instructions:
1. Open GPC-GANS_load.py
2. Modify parameters declared at the top of this file. Make sure to give the project a name.
3. Execute!
