# PSG-GPC-framework

This is the code base used in Smith et al. 2020 to create PSG configuration files and submit jobs to the Goddard Private Cloud. It has been updated to create configuration files for the current (as of 05/08/20) version of PSG.

Current version notes: An installation of PSG in a docker container is required to execute the files, but included files can create configuration files.

Basic use instructions:
1. Open GPC-GANS_load.py
2. Modify parameters declared at the top of this file. Make sure to give the project a name.
3. Execute!
